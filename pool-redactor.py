"""Privacy redactor + miner lookup for the ZKas pool's public stats.

Computes ALL pool stats (pool + per-worker hashrate, shares, blocks) directly
from the stratum bridge's per-instance Prometheus metrics, so the dashboard works
independent of the bridge's /api/stats aggregator. Every wallet address is masked
on the public feed; a miner sees their own full stats via /api/miner.

  GET /api/stats          -> pool-wide stats, every address MASKED.
  GET /api/miner?address= -> stats for ONE address (supply the full address).

Bind loopback; nginx proxies it.
